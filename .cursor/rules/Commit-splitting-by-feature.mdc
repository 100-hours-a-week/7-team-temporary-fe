description: Enforce feature-based git commit splitting (FSD)
scope: repository
priority: high

When asked to create or suggest git commits, always follow these rules:

[Commit grouping rules]
- One commit must represent exactly one feature, responsibility, or use-case.
- Follow Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) boundaries strictly.
  - A single commit must not span multiple slices (feature/entity/shared).
- Do not group unrelated changes even if they are small.

[Separation rules]
- UI changes, business logic changes, and style/token changes must be in separate commits.
- Refactoring must never be mixed with feature additions or bug fixes.
- Design tokens or shared styles (shared/styles) must always be a standalone commit.

[Commit message rules]
- Use Conventional Commits format.
- Examples:
  - feat(auth): add login mutation
  - style(shared): apply color tokens
  - refactor(planner): extract timeline logic

[Output format]
- List commits sequentially.
- Each commit must include:
  - Commit message
  - Explicit list of included files

If changes do not clearly belong to the same feature or responsibility, split them into separate commits.
