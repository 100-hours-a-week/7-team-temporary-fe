## Shared UI
- Shared UI lives under `shared/ui`.
- shadcn wrappers live under `shared/ui/shadcn`.
- Design tokens live under `shared/styles`.
- Shared UI must not include business logic or domain decisions.
- Do not add domain-meaning props such as `isOwner`, `canEdit`.
- If domain rules are required, move the component to feature/widget.

## Styling
- Emotion is allowed only for policy-driven UI.
- Emotion is forbidden in `shared/ui`.

## Policy-driven UI definition
- Styles change based on time, state, or permission.
- Tailwind conditional expressions are insufficient.

## Motion
- Mobile-first and responsive layout.
- Prefer relative units over fixed pixels.
- Motion library usage:
  - Simple interaction → react-bits
  - Timeline / scroll / complex sequences → GSAP
- Animate using `transform` and `opacity` only.
- Do not animate `height`, `width`, `top`, `left`.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Motion hooks must run in `"use client"` components only.
