## Forms
- Form components handle only:
  - input rendering
  - validation
  - form model creation

## Models / DTO
- Form model and Request DTO types live in `features/*/model/types.ts`.
- DTO transformation is performed in mutation `dtoFn`.
- Server responses must be validated against entity schemas.
- Map server entities to ViewModels before passing to UI.
- Do not reuse server response types directly in UI components.
